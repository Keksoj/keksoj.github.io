# My blog, powered by Hugo

Check out [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a great blogging tool for coders.

I use the [LoveIt theme](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt)
made by [dillonzq](https://github.com/dillonzq),
a Shanghai-based developper who wrote a neat `config.toml`
especially made for chinese language enthousiasts:

```toml
# Page config
# 文章页面配置
[params.page]
  # whether to hide a page from home page
  # 是否在主页隐藏一篇文章
  hiddenFromHomePage = false
```
