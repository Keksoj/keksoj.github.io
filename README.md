# My blog, powered by Hugo

Check out [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a great blogging tool for coders.


I use the [Blowfish theme](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish)
theme.



### To clone the repo

This is a note for myself
There is a submodule attached, so be sure to try:

    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Keksoj/Keksoj.github.io.git

Check that hugo is installed on the machine.
It is packaged for Arch at least.

### Run locally

    hugo serve

Then check `localhost:1313`.

### Generate the static site

    hugo
