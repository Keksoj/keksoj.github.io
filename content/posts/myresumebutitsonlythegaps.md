This is an answer to all those recruiters asking "How do you explain this gap in your resume?".

I couldn't stand pretending to be a healthy human being, so here is the truth.

(born 1986)

-   **2004 - 2005**, _Caen, Normandy_. First year of a Physics Measurements degree. Failed spectacularly.
-   **2007-10 - 2007-12**, _Stuttgart, Germany_. Wandering in Germany searching for a job.
-   **2008-10 - 2009-03**, _Heidelberg, Germany_. Learning japanese at the university hoping to work in Japan. Wow that went well.
-   **2009-03 - 2009-10**, _Germany, Czech Republic_. Back-packing speaking esperanto and wwoofing. That one was nice actually.
-   **2009-10 - 2010-02**, _Calais, France_. Bachelor degree of industrial engineering. Ended up crying, shaving my head and doing drugs. But hey I discovered Linux.
-   **2010-10**, _Frankfurt_. Searching for a job in Germany, ended in intense feelings of depression and worthlessness.
-   **2011-01 - 2011-03**, _Israel & Berlin_. Esperanto meetings, visiting Israel, hanging in Berlin and -surprise- doing drugs.
-   **2015-01 - 2015-03**, _Caen, Normandy_. Dropped out of university, searched for a job in an unrelated field, feeling miserable and inadequate.
-   **2018-09**, _India_. Visiting northern India and losing all my life savings in an elaborate scam.
-   **2018-10**, _KÃ¶ln, Germany_. Trying to make a new life in Germany. Oh hi, worthlessness, I didn't miss you.
-   **2019-01 - 2021-02**, _Caen, Normandy_. Learned programming on my own, living on unemployment benefits, then spent six months looking for a job, facing refusal after refusal. Strong feelings of inadequacy and sadness.
