# About myself

My name is Emmanuel Bosquet aka Keksoj (=cookies in esperanto).
I am an apprentice at [Clever Cloud](clever-cloud.com), hired to write some Rust.

I am currently working on our reverse proxy written in Rust, [S≈çzu](https://github.com/sozu-proxy/sozu).

A definite part of coding, in my opinion, is to write documentation.
Readmes are my creed, markdown is my holy sword.
I am embarked on a journey to make code ever more clear and readable, so that even a jerk like me can understand it.

Aside from programming, I love languages (especially german) and playing guitar.
