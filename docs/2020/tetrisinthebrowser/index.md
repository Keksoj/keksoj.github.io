# Tetris in the browser


One day I understood I could write javascript the proper wayÂ :

-   object-oriented
-   with separate files
-   with JSdocs types
-   as far away from the HTML as possible

AND have it work in the browser.

So I ported my dear tetris logic [I had written in Rust for the terminal](https://github.com/keksoj/tetris)
into the browser, using [canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp).

[Play it here](https://emmanuelbosquet.com/tetris-vanilla/).
I'm afraid it only works on the desktop, and it may be buggy, but hey I made a tetris, how awesome is that?
