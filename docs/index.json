[{"categories":null,"content":"I found myself wondering about unix sockets while working on Sozu, a reverse proxy written in Rust. A bunch of Sōzu issues led me to dig into Sōzu channels, which themselves make use of Metal I/O ’s implementation of unix sockets. Here the questions, summed up: what is a unix socket? what is a unix listener? what is a unix stream? So here we go.

As myself, you may have heard that in unix, everything is a file. Unix sockets seem to be a good example of this principle. Empty files of sorts, only there to be written onto, and read from.

I am an apprentice at Clever Cloud, hired to write some Rust. I am currently working on our reverse proxy written in Rust, Sōzu. A definite part of coding, in my opinion, is to write documentation. Readmes are my creed, markdown is my holy sword. I am embarked on a journey to make code ever more clear and readable, so that even a jerk like me can understand it. Aside from programming, I love languages (especially german) and playing guitar. ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/about/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"","uri":"/about/"}]
